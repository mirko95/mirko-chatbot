My name is Mirko Messina. I'm a student currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz. Originally from Catania, Italy, I moved to Vienna in 2019, where I continue to grow both personally and professionally. I'm passionate about the world of IT, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence and its real-world applications.

I have hands-on experience with Python, machine learning, and web development, and I'm building a personal portfolio that reflects my passion and curiosity. I'm a fast learner, always eager to explore new technologies and collaborate on meaningful projects. I speak Italian, English, and I'm working on improving my German.

Outside of academics, Iâ€™m a food lover with a soft spot for Asian cuisine, and I enjoy discovering new cultures and perspectives through travel and conversation.
